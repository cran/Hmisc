3.3-1 3/29/2007
      Created functions trunc.POSIXt, ceil.POSIXt, round.POSIXt to do
      those ops on POSIXt objects.

      Placed Hmisc in a namespace

      Factored out category levels that are identical (and in the same
      order) for multiple variables.  Changed print and html methods
      accordingly, and made new default for html output, levelType='list'.

      new argument levelType in html.contents.data.frame

      enhanced html.data.frame to set column headings in h2

      had forgotten to update defaults for nk, tlinear
      
      added curtail option (default: FALSE) for type='regression' to
      set imputed values to the boundaries of real data if outside

      added datadensity argument to plot.aregImpute

      fixed bug with curtail, added datadensity argument to
      plot.aregImpute

      fixed typo related to bass argument

      fixed bug in latex.describe to translate underscores in variable
      names when listing those with all NAs

      fixed inmChoice by unclassing first argument when pasting

      handled underscore in dataset name in latex.describe by calling
      latexTranslate

      Finished addition of listunique and listnchar, handled listing
      of character values in latex.describe.*

      listunique and listnchar

      For listunique option ignored multiple white spaces, leading and
      trailing white spaces, and case in tabulating character strings.

      For listunique ignored leading and trailing white space,
      multiple white spaces, and case when tabulating character
      strings. Carriage returns without new lines are changed to a single
      space.

      Modified extracolheads such that when cgroup and n.cgroup are
      used in a latex.summary.formula.reverse statement the extra N=
      columns line up correctly.

      added boot.method argument to implement approximate Bayesian
      bootstrap when group is not used

      'R/dates.s'  reworked floor.cron and ceiling.cron for a better implementation.
      
      'R/inc-dec.s' created 2 new functions 'inc<-' and 'dec<-'.  'inc<-' increments
      'x' by value assigned to it.  'dec<-' does the same thing but decrements 'x'.

      'R/responseSummary.s' changed 'responseSummary' 'FUN' argument
      so that is it run on each row of the response instead of the
      entriorty of the response.

      'R/latexObject.s' changed names of constant escapes.

      'R/combine.s' functions to perform element wise combination.

      'R/print.char.list.s'  various code simplifications.

      'R/default.arg.s'  a function to extact the default value of
      a function argument.

      'man/valueTags.Rd'  added a new line to end of file.

      Corrected extra escapes in latexSN function.  fixes #10.

3.2-1 1/25/2007:
      Hmisc function 'ecdf' has been renamed 'Ecdf' to deconfilt it
      with the existing 'ecdf' function in base.

      Fixed Bug in format.df that would create numbers with many
      trailing zeros.

      Added arguments 'math.row.names' and 'math.col.names' to
      indecate that the row or col names should be wrapped in the
      latex math enviroment.

      Fixed problem with 'histbackback' function.
