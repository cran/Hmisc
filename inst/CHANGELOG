3.2-1 1/25/2007:
      Hmisc function 'ecdf' has been renamed 'Ecdf' to deconfilt it
      with the existing 'ecdf' function in base.

      Fixed Bug in format.df that would create numbers with many
      trailing zeros.

      Added arguments 'math.row.names' and 'math.col.names' to
      indecate that the row or col names should be wrapped in the
      latex math enviroment.

      Fixed problem with 'histbackback' function.
